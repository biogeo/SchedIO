An Arduino sketch and Matlab/Psychtoolbox code for using an Arduino as a simple digital I/O device, for which the Arduino can control the timing of I/O events, letting the computer running Matlab/Psychtoolbox "fire-and-forget" these events. E.g., the computer can send a few-bytes command over the serial port to tell the Arduino "Set pin 7 high, then in 200 milliseconds, set it low again." Useful for situations where precise timing of pulses is important (e.g., controlling a device like a solenoid), but the computer running Matlab/Psychtoolbox has other things to be doing (e.g., showing stimuli).

This code is released under the MIT license (do whatever you like with it, but don't blame me if it doesn't work); see the LICENSE file for the full text.

Have fun!
